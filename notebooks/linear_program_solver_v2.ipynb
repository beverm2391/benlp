These are the fastest linear programming solvers in SciPy, especially for large, sparse problems; which of these two is faster is problem-dependent. The other solvers (‘interior-point’, ‘revised simplex’, and ‘simplex’) are legacy methods and will be removed in SciPy 1.11.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method highs-ds is a wrapper of the C++ high performance dual revised simplex implementation (HSOL) [13], [14]. Method highs-ipm is a wrapper of a C++ implementation of an interior-point method [13]; it features a crossover routine, so it is as accurate as a simplex solver. Method highs chooses between the two automatically. For new code involving linprog, we recommend explicitly choosing one of these three method values.\n",
    "\n",
    "New in version 1.6.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method interior-point uses the primal-dual path following algorithm as outlined in [4]. This algorithm supports sparse constraint matrices and is typically faster than the simplex methods, especially for large, sparse problems. Note, however, that the solution returned may be slightly less accurate than those of the simplex methods and will not, in general, correspond with a vertex of the polytope defined by the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "New in version 1.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method revised simplex uses the revised simplex method as described in [9], except that a factorization [11] of the basis matrix, rather than its inverse, is efficiently maintained and used to solve the linear systems at each iteration of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "New in version 1.3.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method simplex uses a traditional, full-tableau implementation of Dantzig’s simplex algorithm [1], [2] (not the Nelder-Mead simplex). This algorithm is included for backwards compatibility and educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "New in version 0.15.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying interior-point, revised simplex, or simplex, a presolve procedure based on [8] attempts to identify trivial infeasibilities, trivial unboundedness, and potential problem simplifications. Specifically, it checks for:\n",
    "\n",
    "rows of zeros in A_eq or A_ub, representing trivial constraints;\n",
    "\n",
    "columns of zeros in A_eq and A_ub, representing unconstrained variables;\n",

    "column singletons in A_eq, representing fixed variables; and\n",
    "\n",
    "column singletons in A_ub, representing simple bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If presolve reveals that the problem is unbounded (e.g. an unconstrained and unbounded variable has negative cost) or infeasible (e.g., a row of zeros in A_eq corresponds with a nonzero in b_eq), the solver terminates with the appropriate status code. Note that presolve terminates as soon as any sign of unboundedness is detected; consequently, a problem may be reported as unbounded when in reality the problem is infeasible (but infeasibility has not been detected yet). Therefore, if it is important to know whether the problem is actually infeasible, solve the problem again with option presolve=False.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither infeasibility nor unboundedness are detected in a single pass of the presolve, bounds are tightened where possible and fixed variables are removed from the problem. Then, linearly dependent rows of the A_eq matrix are removed, (unless they represent an infeasibility) to avoid numerical difficulties in the primary solve routine. Note that rows that are nearly linearly dependent (within a prescribed tolerance) may also be removed, which can change the optimal solution in rare cases. If this is a concern, eliminate redundancy from your problem formulation and run with option rr=False or presolve=False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several potential improvements can be made here: additional presolve checks outlined in [8] should be implemented, the presolve routine should be run multiple times (until no further simplifications can be made), and more of the efficiency improvements from [5] should be implemented in the redundancy removal routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "After presolve, the problem is transformed to standard form by converting the (tightened) simple bounds to upper bound constraints, introducing non-negative slack variables for inequality constraints, and expressing unbounded variables as the difference between two non-negative variables. Optionally, the problem is automatically scaled via equilibration [12]. The selected algorithm solves the standard form problem, and a postprocessing routine converts the result to a solution to the original problem.\n",
