The profit on a case of beer mugs is $25 while the profit on a case of champagne glasses is $20. The cups are manufactured with a machine called a plastic extruder which feeds on plastic resins. Each case of beer mugs requires 20 lbs. of plastic resins to produce while champagne glasses require 12 lbs. per case. The daily supply of plastic resins is limited to at most 1800 pounds. About 15 cases of either product can be produced per hour. At the moment the family wants to limit their work day to 8 hours.\",\n",

At the start of the current week there are 30 units of X and 90 units of Y in stock. Available processing time on machine A is forecast to be 40 hours and on machine B is forecast to be 35 hours. The demand for X in the current week is forecast to be 75 units and for Y is forecast to be 95 units. Company policy is to maximise the combined sum of the units of X and the units of Y in stock at the end of the week. Formulate the problem of deciding how much of each product to make in the current week as a linear program.\"\n",
